# messenger-analytics

## What does this project do?
This project ingests Facebook Messenger conversations and generates analytics.


## How does this project work?
Facebook lets you download all of your Facebook Messenger conversations in JSON format. This can be done by choosing JSON format and selecting only "Messages" to download at https://www.facebook.com/dyi/ .

This program takes the JSON generated by Facebook and goes through it to grab all important data. This includes going through every message and recording info such as sender name, conversation name, message contents, time sent, and more. All of the necessary data is stored nicely in an object and is written to a MongoDB database. 

After the MongoDB database is populated with all of the nececsary message data, the program can then generate analytics on that data. This includes information on how many messages are in a certain conversation, who are the most active participants in a group chat, when are chats the most active and more. I also plan to expand on the analytics in the future- mainly adding in some code to keep track of most used words.


## What tools does this project use to make it work?
The project uses MongoDB to store all of the neccesary Facebook Messenger message data for generating analytics. I took advantage of the MongoDB Java Driver to manage all MongoDB uses such as connecting, writing and reading from a local MongoDB database.
